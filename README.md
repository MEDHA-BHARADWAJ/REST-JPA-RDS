# REST-JPA-RDS
Single page web application using Angular2 (or later  versions), 
RESTful Web Services and JPA/Hibernate along with Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)/MySQL 
to persist and read data to/from a relational database

The front end renders a basic University Webpage which has an embedded link to a student survey
The student seurvey is a form that takes student opinion 
On form submit the same is stored RESTfully by persisting it to the DB.

The code is not hosted or funcitonal but if the backend server details are provided int the properties file then will be fully fucntional

Also the Template for the Table to be created to save the data is also enclosed in the resources folder of the Backend.
